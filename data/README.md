`0_generate_ARdata`

Simulates raters scores according to our model. 
We assume an autoregressive process where the rater's scoring is influences by the ability of the previous scored subject


### Simulation dimensions

N               = 100   # Subjects sample size
I               = 5     # Number of items
R               = 5     # Number of raters

K               = 4     # Number of categories
C               = 1     # Number of students' clusters

sp              = 3     # number of subjects per rater

### Item parameters description


### Subject latent ability distribution


### Raters' Features Distribution

Raters' features: systematic bias, autoregressive coefficient, consistency.
